# Architecture Store

A responsive Architecture store website built as a learning project.

🔗 **Live site:** [architecture-miller.netlify.app/](https://architecture-miller.netlify.app/)

## What I practiced

- **CSS Grid**
- **Flexbox**
- **Media Queries**

## Note

> This is a front-end only project. The contact form and cart buttons are non-functional.
